# ColorBuster

ColorBuster is a tile matching game. If you see matching tiles next to each other and you press them then they will disappear and you will gain points. The amount of tiles needed to be considered a match can be changed via the drop box when playing the game. Created this game using Tile-View-Controller in Java.

Updated ColorBuster with database integration for keeping scores. Also created a special tile when you get one more than the minimum tiles.
